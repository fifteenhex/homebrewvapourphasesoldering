# homebrew vapour phase soldering

## Wha?

I saw this on Macro Reps channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D28uSzCs7-k&t=619s). This looks a ton easier than hacking some janky toaster over setup together (tried it, heat ramp up is too slow, pid controller can't handle it..) and less likely to leave slightly browned boards than using a hot plate directly.

It's worth a go right?

## Materials

- PFPE

  This stuff is like rocking horse poop.. but apparently if you are in Germany there are multiple sources
  that will sell you a smaller amount than a $1000 jug.
  
  - Galden LS230 
    - [electronic-thingks](https://www.electronic-thingks.de/en/electronic-products/soldering-accessory/galden-ls-230.html) -- Should have shipped 100ml to me in Japan, seems out of stock now.
    
  - [3m FC-70](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Fluorinert-Electronic-Liquid-FC-70/?N=5002385+3290667341&rt=rud)
    - Apparently also usable as a Japanese vendor for a VPS machine lists it for their machine.
    - Can't find it to buy anywhere. One site with prices had ~$300 for 25mL!
    - Boiling point is slightly lower at 215C.
